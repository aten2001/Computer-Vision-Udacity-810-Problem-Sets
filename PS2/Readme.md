<p> <b>Disparity Image using stereo and template matching.</b></p> 



<p>Disparity map refers to the apparent pixel difference or motion between a pair of stereo images.
To experience this, try closing one of your eyes and then rapidly close it while opening the other. Objects that are close to you will appear to jump a significant distance while objects further away will move very little.
That motion is the disparity.</p>

<p>In a pair of images derived from stereo cameras, you can measure the apparent motion in pixels for every point and make an intensity image out of the measurements. </p>
